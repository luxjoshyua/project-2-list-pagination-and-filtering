# Treehouse FSJS Techdegree - Project Warm Up

## Fun DOM Manipulation

### Intro

Developers often manipulate the DOM of a web page using JavaScript â€” creating and deleting DOM elements, adding and removing attributes, setting and changing text, etc.  In the upcoming project, you'll write a program that creates, appends and modifies DOM elements and their attributes.  Here's some lightweight practice manipulating a simple DOM that checks in on Treehouse mascot, Mike The Frog, to see what he is up to these days.  You'll use JavaScript to add Mike and his cool tugboat to the DOM in this fun animated Warm Up.

### Instructions

Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome dev tools console.  Then follow along with the comments in the `js/script.js` file to complete this challenge.  Tests have been written to provide extra feedback, and check if the correct elements have been created with the correct attributes and text.  Click the "Test" button to run those tests.  The tests won't check everything, so use the console as needed to log values and check for bugs and errors.  When you have completed this challenge correctly, you should see a tug boat towing Mike the Frog in an innertube, up the river.

Best of luck and happy coding! :)
